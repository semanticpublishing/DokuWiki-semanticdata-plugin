Semantic data plugin for DokuWiki

The Semantic data plugin for DokuWiki is based on the data plugin (http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:data). The underlying sqlite database has been replaced by a SPARQL 1.1 compliant triple store. This has several advantages:

- Performace has increased substantially. As a consequence the plugin can be used as a replacement for the data plugin. Be aware that only the basic functionality has been implemented. Aliases, related pages and tag cloud are not supported in this release.
- A knowledge model can be defined on top of the metada, relating metadata. In this way, metadata that is automatically inferred by the triple store is included in the query results.

Prequisites: Sesame 2.6.0 triple store. http://www.openrdf.org

Please follow the instructions at  http://www.openrdf.org for installing the triple store. You have to setup a repository for dokuwiki to use. Remember the url for access to the repository, e.g. http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/repositories/dokuwiki

NOTICE: The plugin cannot be used together with the sqlite based data plugin!

For installing the plugin, we refer to the DokuWiki documentation. If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in lib/plugins/data/ - if the folder is called different it will not work!

In the admin section of the plugin you can change two settings:
1. The url of Sesame installation: default to http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame
2. The name of the repository, default: dokuwiki
2. The namespace for the data: default to http://www.semanticpublishing.eu/dokuwiki#
